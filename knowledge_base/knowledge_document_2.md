### What is COPD?
* COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.
* COPD is a lung disorder that includes chronic (ongoing) symptoms of:
- Shortness of breath
- Coughing
- Sputum (mucus)
You may have episodes when your symptoms get worse. These are called exacerbations.
* Symptoms of COPD are caused by changes in your airways (chronic bronchitis) or in your air sacs (emphysema). These changes obstruct (block) the flow of air when you breathe.
* COPD symptoms usually get worse over time.

### Who is at risk of getting COPD?
* You are most at risk of getting COPD if you:
- Smoke or used to smoke
- Were exposed to second-hand smoke

### What are the symptoms of COPD?
- Coughing up mucus most days
- Having chest or lung infections often
- Wheezing or noisy breathing
- Trouble breathing when exercising or doing daily activities

### How is COPD diagnosed?
* Talk to your primary health care provider (family doctor of nurse practitioner) about your symptoms. They will:
- Ask about your medical history
- Order a breathing test called spirometry: this test measures how air moves out of your lungs. It will show if the air flow in your lungs is obstructed (blocked). The test may be at a hospital or a community clinic.
* Spirometry is 1 part of a series of breathing tests called Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs). Most people only need spirometry to find out if they have COPD.

### What will happen after I am diagnosed with COPD?
* Your primary health care provider will:
- Review your test results with you
- Help you get the right care
* Education and resources are available through The INSPIRED COPD Outreach ProgramTM and COPD Care and Education Nova Scotia.
* These programs help you learn how to self-manage your COPD. This is done through:
- Telehealth (virtual care offered at your local hospital)
- Virtual (online) care
- Group education
- Home visits
One of our educators will help you find the program that is right for you.

### How can I manage COPD?
* Learning how to self-manage COPD can help you cope with the disease. This may include:
- Medication review and teaching
- How to use a COPD action plan
- Help managing your symptoms
- Smoking or nicotine cessation (stopping) support
