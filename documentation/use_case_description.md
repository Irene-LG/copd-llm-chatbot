# Use Case Description – COPD Exacerbation Early Warning & Home Management Chatbot

## Target Users
Adults in Nova Scotia living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), including:
- Older adults managing their condition at home
- Caregivers assisting COPD patients
- Recently diagnosed individuals navigating symptoms and self-care

Users may have low health literacy, limited digital familiarity, or anxiety about worsening symptoms.

---

## User Pain Points
- Difficulty recognizing whether symptoms (e.g., increased phlegm, fatigue, breathlessness) indicate a flare-up
- Uncertainty about when to seek medical attention vs. manage at home
- Confusion about how to correctly use inhalers or follow a COPD action plan
- Feeling isolated or unsupported between appointments
- Limited access to local health resources or rehab programs

---

## Chatbot Goals
The chatbot provides:
- Education on early warning signs of COPD exacerbation
- Evidence-based self-care guidance (medication use, breathing techniques, avoiding triggers)
- Non-judgmental reminders to reach out to healthcare providers
- Directs users to local resources like:
  - The INSPIRED COPD Outreach Program
  - Nova Scotia Health pulmonary rehabilitation services
  - 811 nurse line or emergency numbers

---

## Success Criteria
- The chatbot accurately answers:
  1. “My phlegm turned yellow and increased—should I see a doctor?”
  2. “What can I do at home to help prevent COPD flare-ups?”
- Users feel reassured, informed, and supported — not dismissed
- All responses include proper disclaimers
- Clear escalation for emergencies (e.g., “Call 911 if you are short of breath or confused”)
- All content reflects the uploaded knowledge base (not hallucinated)

---

## Ethical Considerations
- The chatbot never gives diagnosis or treatment
- Disclaims professional judgment and always defers to real clinicians
- Provides emergency contact pathways when appropriate
- Designed for educational use only; no user data is collected
